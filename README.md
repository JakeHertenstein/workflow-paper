###  About

This repository contains a `.md` file to create a short guide to software tools, aimed at graduate students in the social sciences. It is a revised version of [Choosing Your Workflow Applications](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/workflow-apps.pdf), where the main changes are updated links, additional *obiter dicta*, and a conversion to Markdown format rather than an `org-mode` document. If you have the tools described in here, along with the templates and configuration files [described here](http://www.kieranhealy.org/resources.html), then the `Makefile` can create a nice `.pdf`, `.tex`, or `.html` file for you in a single step.
